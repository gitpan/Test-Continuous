Revision history for Test-Continuous

0.68:
- Closes RT: 52158. Monitor virtually all files.
  .git and .svn directories are ignored, as long as vim and emacs temp files.
- Closes RT: 50286. Thanks Yusuke Watase for providing the patch.

0.67:
- use File::ChangeNotify to watch changed files because it is much faster than
  linux. Thanks to dann++

0.66:
- fix the massive warning coming from File::Modified.

0.65:
- Support TAP::Harness::Remote

0.64:
- now ship with an "autoprove" program as the runner.
- documentation updates

0.63:
- refactor of previous release such that it does not
  require an TAP Archive class to work.
  This is better in general since some harness classes
  do not work with archive easily.
- therefore, remove a few modules from the dependency list

0.62:
- Fix dependencies

0.61:
- Make runtests function delegate unused @ARGV to App::Prove

0.60:
- Report comments in TAP output. So diag or dubious test file can be seen.
- code refactoring.
- Finally some meaningful tests for Test-Continuous!

0.0.5:
- Fix the case that it runs the whole t/ directory if there's
  no subset of tests to run from dependency list. It should only
  run those tests given in the command line.

0.0.4:
- Fix dependency list again. (Grr)

0.0.3:
- [Fix] The growl icon is only working for the first time.
- Accept test files as arguments
